# Baseline Algorithms   {#part:embodied-strategies status=ready}

To help competitors get started, we have implemented some baseline algorithms. These can be built on or used for inspiration. At present, all of these baseline algorithms are for the `LF*` challenges:

- [Classical Duckietown stack](#ros-baseline),
- [Dataset aggregation from simulation](#embodied_il_sim_dagger) (with PyTorch),
- [Reinforcement learning](#embodied_rl) (with PyTorch),
- [Residual Policy learning](#embodied_rpl) (with PyTorch).
 
<!-- - [Reinforcement learning](#embodied_rl) (with PyTorch),
 - [Imitation learning from simulation](#embodied_il_sim) (with tensorflow),
 - [Imitation learning from real logs](#embodied_il_logs) (with tensorflow).
 - [Behavior Cloning](#embodied_bc) (with tensorflow 2.1).
